## Description

  Social networks have become a ubiquitous part of our lives in the 21st century. They provide us with a platform to connect with friends and family, share our experiences and interests, and stay informed about the world around us. They have also provided new opportunities for businesses to reach and interact with customers, and for individuals to build their personal brand and establish their online presence. Overall, social networks have greatly impacted the way we communicate, network and consume information, making them an important part of our daily lives.

  Due to the fact that I created this social network API back-end database to show the capabilities of what it can do. It can help user to create highly-customizable database for creating new users, new thoughts, give reactions and become friends with each other. Thanks to the this API, people can use it to communicate with other people.
